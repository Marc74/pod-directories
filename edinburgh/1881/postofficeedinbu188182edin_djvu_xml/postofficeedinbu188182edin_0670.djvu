	<LINE>with a view to such transmissions. If sent un-</LINE>
	<LINE>registered valuable articles are exposed to risk, and</LINE>
	<LINE>offer a temptation which ought not to be afforded.</LINE>
	<LINE>Letters containing coin, jewellery, or precious</LINE>
	<LINE>articles, cannot be accepted for registration to any</LINE>
	<LINE>country in the Postal Union.</LINE>
	<LINE>By law the Postmaster-General is not responsible</LINE>
	<LINE>for the safe delivery of registered letters or packets,</LINE>
	<LINE>but he is prepared to make good the contents of a</LINE>
	<LINE>registered letter lost while passing through the</LINE>
	<LINE>post to the extent of £2 in certain cases, provided —</LINE>
	<LINE>1. That the sender of the letter duly observed</LINE>
	<LINE>all the conditions of registration required ;</LINE>
	<LINE>2. That the letter was securely enclosed in a</LINE>
	<LINE>reasonably strong cover; and if it con-</LINE>
	<LINE>tained money, that it was enclosed in one of</LINE>
	<LINE>the registered letter envelopes sold by the</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Office for the purpose ;</LINE>
	<LINE>3. That application was made to the Secretary</LINE>
	<LINE>of the Post Office immediately the loss was</LINE>
	<LINE>discovered;</LINE>
	<LINE>[When the complaint is that the contents of a</LINE>
	<LINE>letter have been abstracted, the envelope</LINE>
	<LINE>must accompan}' the application, otherwise</LINE>
	<LINE>the question will not be entertained.]</LINE>
	<LINE>4. That the Postmaster-General, whose decision</LINE>
	<LINE>shall be final, is satisfied that the loss oc-</LINE>
	<LINE>curred while the letter was in the custody of</LINE>
	<LINE>the British Post GflSce, and was not caused</LINE>
	<LINE>by any fault on the part of the sender.</LINE>
	<LINE>No town letter-carrier is allowed to take a letter</LINE>
	<LINE>to be registered ; but in country places where no</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Office is near, letters will be registered by</LINE>
	<LINE>rural post messengers on their walks, whenever it</LINE>
	<LINE>is practicable for them to do so.</LINE>
