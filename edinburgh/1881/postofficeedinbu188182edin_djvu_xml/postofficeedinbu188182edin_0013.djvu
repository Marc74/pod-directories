	<LINE>pleasure in testifying to their efficiency. They thoroughly realize the favourable anticipations which I formed from</LINE>
	<LINE>experiments on inodels shown to me by Mr. Boyle. Having one fitted up in my yacht, I find it has caused a very</LINE>
	<LINE>decided improvement in the draught.</LINE>
