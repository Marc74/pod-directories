	<LINE>also at liberty to desire at the time of issue</LINE>
	<LINE>that the order be crossed like a cheque thus,</LINE>
	<LINE>&amp; Co., and be made payable only through a</LINE>
	<LINE>bank, in which case it is left to his option to give</LINE>
	<LINE>or withhold the name of the payee. Foreign</LINE>
	<LINE>and Colonial Money Orders do not come under</LINE>
	<LINE>this exception.</LINE>
	<LINE>The holder of a Money Order is always at liberty</LINE>
	<LINE>to direct, by crossing it, that it be paid through a</LINE>
	<LINE>bank, even although not originally intended.</LINE>
	<LINE>When application is made for a Money Order</LINE>
	<LINE>payable in London, or at any other town where</LINE>
	<LINE>there is more than one Money Order Office, the</LINE>
	<LINE>remitter should say at which of such ofSces he</LINE>
	<LINE>wishes it to be paid ; otherwise the order can be</LINE>
	<LINE>cashed only at the Head Office. It is not incum-</LINE>
	<LINE>bent on a postmaster to supply such information</LINE>
	<LINE>relative to local or provincial offices.</LINE>
	<LINE>An order once issued cannot be cancelled ; and</LINE>
	<LINE>should repayment or transfer to a different office</LINE>
	<LINE>be required, the remitter or payee must apply to the</LINE>
	<LINE>paying postmaster.</LINE>
	<LINE>In order to enable the remitter to obtain an ac-</LINE>
	<LINE>knowledgment of the receipt of a Money Order</LINE>
	<LINE>before the money is paid, it is arranged that he</LINE>
	<LINE>may make his order payable ten days after date,</LINE>
	<LINE>provided that, in the presence of the postmaster,</LINE>
	<LINE>when he obtains the o-der, he affixes thereto, in</LINE>
	<LINE>the space after the request C, a penny receipt</LINE>
	<LINE>stamp, and write his signature across the stamp.</LINE>
	<LINE>When an order is presented for payment (other-</LINE>
	<LINE>wise than through a bank), the postmaster has</LINE>
	<LINE>first to see that the signature of the payee be</LINE>
	<LINE>in agreement with the advice. He has then to</LINE>
	<LINE>call on the applicant to give the name of the re-</LINE>
	<LINE>mitter; and if the reply be correct, the order will</LINE>
	<LINE>be paid, unless the postmaster have good reason</LINE>
	<LINE>for believing that the applicant is neither the right-</LINE>
	<LINE>ful claimant, nor deputed by him. When an order</LINE>
	<LINE>is paid through a bank, it is sufficient that it be</LINE>
	<LINE>receipted (without regard to any discrepancy be-</LINE>
	<LINE>tween the signature and the name in the advice),</LINE>
	<LINE>and that it be presented (crossed with the name of</LINE>
	<LINE>the receiving bank) by some person known to be</LINE>
	<LINE>in the employment of the bank.</LINE>
	<LINE>Money Orders do not require a receipt stamp.</LINE>
	<LINE>Although at the end of twelve months from that</LINE>
	<LINE>in which it was issued, a Money Order, if still un</LINE>
	<LINE>paid, becomes legally void, nevertheless, when a</LINE>
	<LINE>good reason can be given for the delay in present</LINE>
	<LINE>ing it, an application for paj^mcnt, subject to a</LINE>
	<LINE>certain deduction, is entertained.</LINE>
	<LINE>No application can be entertained for compensa-</LINE>
	<LINE>tion for alleged injury from the non-payment of a</LINE>
	<LINE>Money Order at the expected time.</LINE>
	<LINE>After once paying a Money Order, by whom-</LINE>
	<LINE>soever presented, the office is not liable to any</LINE>
	<LINE>further claim.</LINE>
	<LINE>To guard against any person, even if he obtain</LINE>
	<LINE>possession of a Money Order fraudulently, getting</LINE>
	<LINE>it cashed, the remitter is recommended —</LINE>
	<LINE>i. When he is well known to the payee, to sign the</LINE>
	<LINE>letter enclosing the order with his initials only.</LINE>
	<LINE>2. When this is not the case, either to make tiie</LINE>
	<LINE>order payable ten days after date, or to</LINE>
	<LINE>register the letter enclosing it, or to make</LINE>
	<LINE>the order payable through a bank by cross-</LINE>
	<LINE>ing it like an ordinary cheque.</LINE>
	<LINE>3. When it is not considered expedient to adopt</LINE>
	<LINE>either of these courses, to send the remitter's</LINE>
	<LINE>name (without a knowledge of which pay-</LINE>
	<LINE>ment cannot be obtained) in a separate letter</LINE>
	<LINE>from tliat containing the Money Order; al-</LINE>
	<LINE>though tl)is latter precaution is much less</LINE>
	<LINE>effective than either of the others.</LINE>
	<LINE>Payment of an order cannot be demanded on</LINE>
	<LINE>the same day as that on which the order was</LINE>
	<LINE>issued.</LINE>
	<LINE>In case of the miscarriage or loss of an inland</LINE>
	<LINE>Money Order in transmission through the post, a</LINE>
	<LINE>duplicate is granted on a written application giving</LINE>
	<LINE>particulars to the Controller of the Money Order</LINE>
	<LINE>Office in England, Scotland, or Ireland, as the case</LINE>
	<LINE>may be, where the original order was issued ; but</LINE>
	<LINE>for an order otherwise . lost, a charge of Is. for</LINE>
	<LINE>sums not exceeding £5, and 2s. for sums not ex-</LINE>
	<LINE>ceeding £10 is made for a duplicate order. If it</LINE>
	<LINE>be desired to stop payment of an inland order,</LINE>
	<LINE>application must be made at the office where the</LINE>
	<LINE>order is payable, and a second commission must</LINE>
	<LINE>be paid. If alteration in the name of the payee or</LINE>
	<LINE>remitter of an inland Money Order should be re-</LINE>
	<LINE>quired, application must be made by the remitter</LINE>
	<LINE>to the i^ostmaster of the office at which the order</LINE>
	<LINE>was issued, and a second commission must be paid.</LINE>
	<LINE>Should transfer of payment of an inland order from</LINE>
	<LINE>one office to another in the United Kingdom, or</LINE>
	<LINE>repayment of the amount of an order, be required,</LINE>
	<LINE>an application enclosing the order must be made</LINE>
	<LINE>to the postmaster at whose office the order is pay-</LINE>
	<LINE>able, who will transmit in exchange a new order</LINE>
	<LINE>payable at the place desired, but for a less sum than</LINE>
	<LINE>the original order by the amount of the second com-</LINE>
	<LINE>mission charged for the re-issue. Proper printed</LINE>
	<LINE>forms for making applications in all these cases may</LINE>
	<LINE>be obtained at any Money Order Office. Whenever,</LINE>
	<LINE>on complaint being made, it is found that the neces-</LINE>
	<LINE>sity for an application, entailing the payment of a</LINE>
	<LINE>fresh commission, is attributable to the Post Office,</LINE>
	<LINE>the charge will be remitted to the applicant, and</LINE>
	<LINE>imposed on the officer in fault.</LINE>
	<LINE>A postmaster is required to give information how</LINE>
	<LINE>to apply for a duplicate order, etc., and must furnish</LINE>
	<LINE>the prescribed form of application. If payment oi</LINE>
	<LINE>an order be refused in consequence of the replies</LINE>
	<LINE>to the questions respecting the remitter, or the</LINE>
	<LINE>signature on the order, not corresponding with the</LINE>
	<LINE>entries in the advice, the applicant for payment</LINE>
	<LINE>should communicate with the remitter, and request</LINE>
	<LINE>him to apply personally to the issuing postmaster.</LINE>
	<LINE>No letter-carrier, niral messenger, or other ser-</LINE>
	<LINE>vant of the Post Office is bound to procure a Money</LINE>
	<LINE>Order for any person, or to obtain payment for</LINE>
	<LINE>one ; but such services are not forbidden.</LINE>
	<LINE>Money Orders are issued in the United Kingdom</LINE>
