	<LINE>FOREIGN TELEGRAMS.</LINE>
	<LINE>Foreign telegrams are divided into throe classes</LINE>
	<LINE>— ordinary, code, and cypher. Ordinary telegrams</LINE>
	<LINE>are those compiosed of a series of words, or of</LINE>
	<LINE>words, figure.", and letters conveying an intelli-</LINE>
	<LINE>gible meaning.</LINE>
	<LINE>Code telegrams are those composed of words,</LINE>
	<LINE>the context of which has no intelligible meaning.</LINE>
	<LINE>Proper names are not allowed in the text of code</LINE>
	<LINE>telegrams, except in their natural sense.</LINE>
	<LINE>In European code telegrams, any of the lan-</LINE>
	<LINE>guages in use in Europe or Latin may be em-</LINE>
	<LINE>ployed; but no telegram may contain words of</LINE>
	<LINE>more than one language.</LINE>
	<LINE>In extra-European code telegrams, only English,</LINE>
	<LINE>French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,</LINE>
	<LINE>Dutch, and Latin may be emjjloyed; but words</LINE>
	<LINE>of any or all of these languages will be allowed in</LINE>
	<LINE>one and the same telegram.</LINE>
	<LINE>Cypher telegrams are those containing series or</LINE>
	<LINE>groups of figures or letters having a secret mean-</LINE>
	<LINE>ing; or words not to be found in a standard</LINE>
	<LINE>dictionary of the language. The portion in cypher</LINE>
	<LINE>must be composed exclusively of figures or ex-</LINE>
	<LINE>clusively of letters.</LINE>
	<LINE>Cypher telegrams written in letters are not</LINE>
	<LINE>aecppted for extra European places.</LINE>
	<LINE>The address of the receiver must be paid for,</LINE>
	<LINE>and must not consist of less than two words, a</LINE>
	<LINE>name and town. Example : Hercules, Bombay.</LINE>
	<LINE>The address of the sender is charged for, if</LINE>
	<LINE>transmitted; if not to be transmitted, it must be</LINE>
	<LINE>written at the foot of the form.</LINE>
	<LINE>In European telegrams, the maximum length</LINE>
	<LINE>allowed for a single word is 1.5 letters, in extra-</LINE>
	<LINE>European telegrams 10 letters ; any additional</LINE>
	<LINE>letters being counted and charged for as extra</LINE>
	<LINE>words.</LINE>
	<LINE>Ordinary compound words and names of persons</LINE>
	<LINE>and places, etc., written without break or interrup-</LINE>
	<LINE>tion, are counted as single words. If joined by a</LINE>
	<LINE>hyphen, or separated by an apostrophe or other</LINE>
	<LINE>sign of punctuation, they are counted as so many</LINE>
	<LINE>separate words.</LINE>
	<LINE>A telegram addressed to several persons in the</LINE>
	<LINE>same town, or to the same firm at different</LINE>
	<LINE>localities in the same town, is charged for as a</LINE>
	<LINE>single telegram, and a sum of ■5d. muot be prepaid</LINE>
	<LINE>for every extra copy to be delivered, if the number</LINE>
	<LINE>of chargeable words does not exceed 100; an</LINE>
	<LINE>additional sum of od. being charged for every</LINE>
	<LINE>additional 100 words or part of 100 words.</LINE>
	<LINE>In calculating the charge, all the names and</LINE>
	<LINE>addresses are included.</LINE>
	<LINE>The North American Telegraph Companies do</LINE>
	<LINE>not accept telegrams having multiple addresses.</LINE>
	<LINE>Telegrams may be sent from one place to an-</LINE>
	<LINE>other abroad by post. If the telegram be intended</LINE>
	<LINE>for delivery in the same country no charge for</LINE>
	<LINE>postage is made, unless it be posted from one part</LINE>
	<LINE>to another of China or Japan, for which the charge</LINE>
	<LINE>is Is. 6d.</LINE>
