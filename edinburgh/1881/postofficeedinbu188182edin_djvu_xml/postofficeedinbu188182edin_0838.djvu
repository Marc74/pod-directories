	<LINE>NON-FORFEITABLE POLICIES.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Ordinary Policies of this Company — whether effected by Premiums payable</LINE>
	<LINE>during the whole of Life, or payable during a limited number of years — are issued uuder</LINE>
	<LINE>a comprehensive Non- Forfeiture System, which protects the Assured against Loss in the</LINE>
	<LINE>event of Premiums being discontinued. For explanation see Prospectus, which may be had</LINE>
	<LINE>on application.</LINE>
	<LINE>INCREASING BONUSES.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Bonus System of this Company gives an increasing share of Profits to</LINE>
	<LINE>the Policy-holders as they advance in age. The Bonus declared in 1878 ranged from</LINE>
	<LINE>£1, 2s. lOd. per cent, per annum in the case of Policy-holders who entered the Septen-</LINE>
	<LINE>nial Period at the age of 20, to £10, 15s. 5d. per cent, per annum in the case of the</LINE>
	<LINE>oldest Policy-holder.</LINE>
	<LINE>TERMINABLE PREMIUM PLAN.</LINE>
	<LINE>Intending Policy-holders who may prefer to enjoy their share of the Profits in the form</LINE>
	<LINE>of ultimate relief from the payment of Premiums, are invited to consider this New Scheme.</LINE>
	<LINE>Its important advantage is that, without adding to the cost of an Ordinary Life Policy, it</LINE>
	<LINE>entirely relieves the Policy-holder in Old Age from the payment of Premiums. This is</LINE>
	<LINE>accomplished by an application of the earlier Bonuses on the Policy, leaving the larger</LINE>
	<LINE>Bonuses which may be declared later in life to be added to the Sum Assured, or exchanged</LINE>
	<LINE>for their value in cash.</LINE>
	<LINE>LIFE BUSINESS ONLY IS TRANSACTED BT THE COMPANY.</LINE>
