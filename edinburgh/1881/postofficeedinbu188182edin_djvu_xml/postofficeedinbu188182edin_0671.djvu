	<LINE>and when any person applies to him for postage</LINE>
	<LINE>labels, the messenger must either supply them, or</LINE>
	<LINE>(if he have none in his possession) must, without</LINE>
	<LINE>extra charge, receive the postage in money, and on</LINE>
	<LINE>his arrival at the post office obtain labels for the</LINE>
	<LINE>amount, and affix them carefully to the letters.</LINE>
	<LINE>All postmasters in the United Kingdom atwhose</LINE>
	<LINE>offices money order business is transacted, are</LINE>
	<LINE>permitted, though not compelled, to purchase</LINE>
	<LINE>postage stamps from the public (provided the</LINE>
	<LINE>stamps be not soiled or otherwise damaged), at a</LINE>
	<LINE>charge of 2^ per cent. ; the charge, however, never</LINE>
	<LINE>being less than one halfpenny. Under this arrange-</LINE>
	<LINE>ment the charges are as follows : For stamps not</LINE>
	<LINE>exceeding Is. 8d. in value, id. ; 3s. 4d., Id. ; 5s., lid. ;</LINE>
	<LINE>6s. 8d., 2d. ; 8s. 4d., 2Jd., and so on. No separate</LINE>
	<LINE>stamps can be purchased, or less than two adher-</LINE>
	<LINE>ing to each other.</LINE>
	<LINE>In consequence of representations made to the</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Office by various firms, that there is reason to</LINE>
	<LINE>believe that their postage stamps were purloined</LINE>
	<LINE>by persons in their employ, the department has</LINE>
	<LINE>recommended that the name or initials of firms,</LINE>
	<LINE>etc., be either printed on the back of the stamps (by</LINE>
	<LINE>arrangement with the Inland Eevenue Office,</LINE>
	<LINE>Somerset House), or perforated tlirough the stamps</LINE>
	<LINE>by means of a machine devised for the purpose,</LINE>
	<LINE>so that, the sale of such stamps being thereby</LINE>
	<LINE>rendered difficult (postmasters having been in-</LINE>
	<LINE>structed not to purchase any of them), there may</LINE>
	<LINE>be little or no temptation to steal them.</LINE>
	<LINE>The perforation of the stamps on post cards,</LINE>
	<LINE>wrappers, and embossed envelopes with initials is</LINE>
	<LINE>also not objected to.</LINE>
	<LINE>AETICLES NOT ALLOWED TO BE</LINE>
