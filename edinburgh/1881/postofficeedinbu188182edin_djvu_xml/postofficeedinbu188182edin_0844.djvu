	<LINE>THE SCOTTISH EQUITABLE is a Purely Mutual Office. There are no Shareholders</LINE>
	<LINE>to absorb any portion of the Profits, -which are therefore wholly divided among the</LINE>
	<LINE>holders of Participating Policies. Its leading features are — Unquestionahle Security, Liberal</LINE>
	<LINE>Conditions of Insurance, and Early Participation in Profits.</LINE>
	<LINE>By Resolutions recently passed, the conditions as to Foreign Residence and Travel have</LINE>
	<LINE>been made much more liberal and greatly simplified. Most of the Policies after Five</LINE>
	<LINE>Years' endurance are freed from all conditions, except the payment of the Ordinary Premium,</LINE>
	<LINE>The Existing Assurances, including Bonus Additions, are . £8,400,000</LINE>
	<LINE>The Annual Eevenue is 321,000</LINE>
	<LINE>And the Accumulated Funds are . . . . . . 2,485,000</LINE>
	<LINE>At the General Meeting of the Society on the 24th June 1878, the Profit realized in</LINE>
	<LINE>the last Five Years was reported as £234,637. New Bonus Additions, amounting to</LINE>
	<LINE>£376,700, were made to the Policies, being at the rate of £l, 2s. 6d. per cent, per annum</LINE>
	<LINE>on the Sum Assured and Previous Bonuses, or equivalent to an average addition, calculated</LINE>
	<LINE>simply upon the original sum assured, at the rate of £1, 6s. 7d. per cent, for each year the</LINE>
	<LINE>Policy had been in force since the last Investigation. Policies issued in the first three years</LINE>
	<LINE>of the Society are now more than doubled in amount. The Directors are of opinion that</LINE>
	<LINE>the Members may confidently look forward to a further increase in the rate of Bonus at the</LINE>
	<LINE>Hext Division of Profits in 1883.</LINE>
	<LINE>NoN-FoRFElTABLE POLICIES are now granted by the Society on a new and improved</LINE>
	<LINE>plan, which combines the advantages of Moderate Premiums payable for a limited number</LINE>
	<LINE>of years (11, 22, or 33), Ultimate Participation in the Profits, Fixed Surrender Values, and</LINE>
	<LINE>the issue of Fully Paid-up Policies without special application to the Directors.</LINE>
	<LINE>Settlement Policies with special advantages are granted under the ' Married Women's</LINE>
	<LINE>Policies of Assurance (Scotland) Act, 1880,' free from all claims of creditors in the event</LINE>
	<LINE>of subsequent insolvency.</LINE>
	<LINE>Loans are granted in connection with Life Insurance, on Life Interests, Reversions,</LINE>
	<LINE>and other approved Security. The Directors are also prepared to entertain proposals for</LINE>
	<LINE>the sale of Reversions to the Society.</LINE>
