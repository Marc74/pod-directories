	<LINE>Extract from 'Paper $( printing ^Tratics Journal,' p. 35, Mec. 1880 :</LINE>
	<LINE>'Mr. James Hogg, 9-a North Bank Street, Edinburgh, forwards a few samples of what he terms</LINE>
	<LINE>" ordinary mercantile work," which are really tasteful samples of display, excellently worked. One</LINE>
	<LINE>or two are set entirely in the new American faces, and nearly all owe much of their good looks to the</LINE>
	<LINE>ornamental combinations from the same source. A card for a Cathedral celebration, worked in silver</LINE>
	<LINE>on white card, is very neat and tasteful, and the whole parcel is much superior to that with which we</LINE>
	<LINE>usually associate the term " ordinary.'"</LINE>
