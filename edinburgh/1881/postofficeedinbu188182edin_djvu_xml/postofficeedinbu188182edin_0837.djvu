	<LINE>LIFE DEPARTMENT.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Premiums charged are strictly moderate, — those in Class B being among the most</LINE>
	<LINE>economical rates charged for Profit Policies by British Offices.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Bonuses have hitherto been of highly satisfactory amount ; and they may be applied</LINE>
	<LINE>to increase the sum assured, to reduce or extinguish the Annual Premium, or to make the</LINE>
	<LINE>YoYicY payable during life.</LINE>
	<LINE>Under the improved Non-Forfeitable System adopted by this Company, Policies may</LINE>
	<LINE>be kept in force by application of the Surrender Value to meet Overdue Premiums, thus</LINE>
	<LINE>entirely obviating all loss from accidental omission to pay the Premium at the proper time.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Surrender Values granted by the Company in the case of Ordinary Policies are on</LINE>
	<LINE>a liberal scale, 60 per cent, of every Premium paid after the Second Year being at present</LINE>
	<LINE>allowed in Class Al.</LINE>
	<LINE>World-wide Policies, free from all restrictive conditions as to foreign residence, are</LINE>
	<LINE>granted by the Company without extra charge, where the Proposer is upwards of 25 years</LINE>
	<LINE>of age, and has satisfied the Directors that he is not likely to go abroad.</LINE>
	<LINE>Unsurpassed Security is afforded to the Life Policy-holders, the Reserves being un-</LINE>
	<LINE>usually large, and the Life Funds being entirely free from all liability in connection</LINE>
	<LINE>with the Fire business.</LINE>
	<LINE>FIRE DEPARTMENT.</LINE>
	<LINE>Insurances against loss or damage by Fire are granted on the most favourable terms.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Rates of Premium are strictly moderate, and the Security afforded is of the highest</LINE>
	<LINE>order, the Fire Reserve Fund, exclusive of Capital, being greatly larger in proportion to</LINE>
	<LINE>the Annual Income from Premiums than is usually the case in other Offices.</LINE>
