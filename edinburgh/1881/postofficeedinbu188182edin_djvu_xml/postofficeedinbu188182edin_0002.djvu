	<LINE>This society differs in its principles from otter Offices.</LINE>
	<LINE>Instead of charging rates higher than are necessary, and afterwards returning</LINE>
	<LINE>the excess in the shape of periodical Bonuses, it gives from the first as large an</LINE>
	<LINE>Assurance as the Premiums will with safety bear — reserving the Whole Surplus</LINE>
	<LINE>for those members who live long enough to secure the Common Fund from loss.</LINE>
	<LINE>A Policy for £1200 to £1250 may thus at most ages be had for the Premium usually</LINE>
	<LINE>charged (with profits) for £1000 only ; whUe, by reserving the surplus, large</LINE>
	<LINE>additions have been given — and may be expected in the future — on the Policies</LINE>
	<LINE>of those who live to participate.</LINE>
	<LINE>The 43d Annual General Meeting was held on 27th April 1881.</LINE>
	<LINE>The New Assurances in 1880 were 1769 for £1,054,566; Premiums received,;</LINE>
	<LINE>£399,538; Total Eeceipts, £566,444.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Funds (increased in year by £283,922) were, at 31st December, £3,913,252.</LINE>
	<LINE>The cost of Management (excluding Income Tax) was 9-4 per cent, on the Premiums, and 6*6 per!</LINE>
	<LINE>cent, on the Total Income. And it may be noted that the ratio of Expenditure has steadily</LINE>
	<LINE>fallen, as the Income increased, in each succeeding year of the Septennium. *■</LINE>
	<LINE>The Septennial Progress is shown in the following Table:—</LINE>
	<LINE>FIFTH SEPTENNIAL INVESTIGATION. .,</LINE>
	<LINE>The Report showed a Surplus of £624,473, which, after reserving one-third (£208,158)^</LINE>
	<LINE>as a Guarantee, falls to be divided in terms of the laws. The number of PoUcies entitled</LINE>
	<LINE>to participate is now 6662, notwithstanding which the rates of addition will be quite as</LINE>
	<LINE>high as at any since the first. The additions to Policies sharing for the first time will vary</LINE>
	<LINE>from 17 or 18 to upwards of 30 -pev cent.</LINE>
	<LINE>REPORTS, with Statement o/Peinciples, may be had on application.</LINE>
