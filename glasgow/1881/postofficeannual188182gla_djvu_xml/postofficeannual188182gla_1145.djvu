	<LINE>REGISTRATION, &amp;c.</LINE>
	<LINE>(10.) Modes ofprepaTjment.</LINE>
	<LINE>The prepayment of Inland letters, newspapers,</LINE>
	<LINE>and book packets can only be effected by means of</LINE>
	<LINE>postage stamps, except that inland letters and booh</LINE>
	<LINE>packets may be prepaid in money at the Chief Office,</LINE>
	<LINE>Glasgow, provided the amount paid be never less</LINE>
	<LINE>than £5. The prepayment, however, cannot be made</LINE>
	<LINE>partly in money and partly with stamps.</LINE>
	<LINE>(11.) Registration.</LINE>
	<LINE>1. The fee for registering a letter, newspaper,</LINE>
	<LINE>book-packet, or other article, passing between any</LINE>
	<LINE>two places in the United Kingdom is twopence.</LINE>
	<LINE>2. No article addressed to initials or to a fictitious</LINE>
	<LINE>name can be registered; the prohibition, however,</LINE>
	<LINE>does not extend to letters addressed to the care of a</LINE>
	<LINE>person or firm.</LINE>
	<LINE>3. Every article presented for registration must be</LINE>
	<LINE>* The posting of these notices is confined strictly to</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Offices where Money Order business is transacted ;</LINE>
	<LINE>consequently, whenever such business is suspended at</LINE>
	<LINE>any office none of these notices can there he received.</LINE>
	<LINE>enclosed in a strong envelope, securely fastened. If</LINE>
	<LINE>the article contains money it must, in order to gain</LINE>
	<LINE>the benefit of the guarantee described at par. 9, be</LINE>
	<LINE>enclosed in a registered letter envelope sold by the</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Office , and if coins are sent, they must on no</LINE>
	<LINE>account be put in loose, but must be packed and enclosed</LINE>
	<LINE>in such a way as to move about as little as possible.</LINE>
	<LINE>4. Registered articles must be prepaid as re-</LINE>
	<LINE>gards both postage and registration fee; except</LINE>
	<LINE>official letters for Government Offices in London,</LINE>
	<LINE>Dublin, or Edinburgh, which may be registered</LINE>
	<LINE>on prepayment, in stamps, of the registration fee</LINE>
	<LINE>only.</LINE>
	<LINE>5. Every article to be registered must be given to</LINE>
	<LINE>an agent of the Post Office, and a receipt obtained</LINE>
	<LINE>for it, and should on no account he dropped into the</LINE>
	<LINE>letter-box. If, contrary to this rule, an article marked</LINE>
	<LINE>" Registered " be dropped into the letter box it will,</LINE>
	<LINE>if directed to any place in the United Kingdom, be</LINE>
	<LINE>liable to a registration fee of 8cZ., instead of the ordi-</LINE>
	<LINE>nary fee of 2d.</LINE>
	<LINE>6. At all Post Offices the latest time for posting</LINE>
	<LINE>registered articles on the payment of the ordinary</LINE>
	<LINE>fee is entered in the notice exhibited in the</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Office window. Usually this time is fixed at</LINE>
	<LINE>half an hour before the closing of the Letter Box ;</LINE>
	<LINE>but at all Head Offices articles bearing a late fee</LINE>
	<LINE>of fourpence, in addition to the ordinary registra-</LINE>
	<LINE>tion fee, may be registered at any time within the</LINE>
	<LINE>half hour, until the letter-box is closed, if the office</LINE>
	<LINE>is open to the public so long.</LINE>
	<LINE>7. When several letters are sent by the same</LINE>
	<LINE>person for registration they should be accompanied</LINE>
	<LINE>with a list (in duplicate) of the addresses ; one list</LINE>
	<LINE>to be retained at the Post Office, and the other, when</LINE>
	<LINE>signed, to be returned by the bearer. This practice</LINE>
	<LINE>(which is adopted by many bankers) saves time both</LINE>
	<LINE>to the public and the Department.</LINE>
	<LINE>8. The registration of articles makes their</LINE>
	<LINE>transmission much more secure, inasmuch as they</LINE>
	<LINE>can be traced through their whole course ; thus the</LINE>
	<LINE>loss of a registered article is a rare occurrence. Never-</LINE>
	<LINE>theless, large sums of money or other articles of great</LINE>
	<LINE>value should not be sent through the post, even if</LINE>
	<LINE>registered ; as the machinery of the Department is not</LINE>
	<LINE>arranged with a view to such transmissions. If sent</LINE>
	<LINE>unregistered valuable articles are exposed to risk, and</LINE>
	<LINE>offer a temptation which ought not to be afforded.</LINE>
	<LINE>Inland letters or packets which contain coin,</LINE>
	<LINE>watches, or jewellery, if posted without registration,</LINE>
	<LINE>are treated as registered, and charged on delivery</LINE>
	<LINE>with a registration fee of eightpence in addition</LINE>
	<LINE>to the ordinary postage; and any such letters or</LINE>
	<LINE>packets which cannot be registered in time to be for-</LINE>
	<LINE>warded by the Mail for which they are posted, are</LINE>
	<LINE>detained for the next despatch.</LINE>
	<LINE>9. By law the Postmaster General is not re-</LINE>
	<LINE>sponsible for the safe delivery of registered article?,</LINE>
	<LINE>but henceforth he will be prepared to make good the</LINE>
	<LINE>contents of a registered article lost while passing</LINE>
	<LINE>through the Post to the extent of £2 in certain cases,</LINE>
	<LINE>provided that the sender duly observed all the con-</LINE>
	<LINE>ditions of registration required ; that the article</LINE>
	<LINE>was securely enclosed in a reasonably strong cover;</LINE>
	<LINE>and, if it contained money, that it was enclosed</LINE>
	<LINE>in one of the registered letter envelopes sold by the</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Office for the purpose; that application was</LINE>
	<LINE>made to the secretary of the Post Office immediately</LINE>
	<LINE>the loss was discovered. (When the complaint is</LINE>
