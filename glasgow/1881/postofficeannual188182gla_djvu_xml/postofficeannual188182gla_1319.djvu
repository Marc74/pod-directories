	<LINE>ROYAL INFIRMARY.</LINE>
	<LINE>rHIS -institution has now been in existence for nearly a Century.</LINE>
	<LINE>It has accommodation for 570 Patients, and the Wards are</LINE>
	<LINE>generally full. Though managed on the strictest economic prin-</LINE>
	<LINE>iples, the Ordinary Expenditure of last year was upwards of</LINE>
	<LINE>1^25,000 ; while the Ordinary Income, including £4300 of Interest</LINE>
	<LINE>n Legacies invested, was a little over £18,000.</LINE>
	<LINE>For a number of years the Ordinary Expenditure has been, on</LINE>
	<LINE>In average, about £4000 in excess of the Ordinary Income. There</LINE>
	<LINE>las, consequently, been a serious drain upon Invested Funds ;</LINE>
	<LINE>i,nd this cannot long continue, as a considerable portion is beyond</LINE>
	<LINE>he control of the Directors, and partly held in Trust, liable to</LINE>
	<LINE>ilepayment.</LINE>
	<LINE>They, therefore, earnestly appeal to the Public for increased</LINE>
	<LINE>iberality, in order that the same state of efficiency may be</LINE>
	<LINE>naintained, without the necessity of curtailing the accommodation.</LINE>
	<LINE>The most recent improvements in the Nursing System, and in</LINE>
	<LINE>,he Domestic Arrangements, have been introduced ; and the</LINE>
	<LINE>Directors have reason to believe that there is no similar Insti-</LINE>
	<LINE>;ution in the Kingdom, in which Patients are so well provided</LINE>
	<LINE>or at so little expense.</LINE>
	<LINE>Copies of the Annual Eeport, which gives full particulars, will</LINE>
	<LINE>k [)e gladly sent on application ; and Contributions will be thankfully</LINE>
	<LINE>eceived and acknowledged by</LINE>
