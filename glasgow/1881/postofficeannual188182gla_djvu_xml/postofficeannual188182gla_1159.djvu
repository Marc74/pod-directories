	<LINE>35</LINE>
	<LINE>1</LINE>
	<LINE>18. Most of the Telegraph Offices in the United</LINE>
	<LINE>Kingdom are closed between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. ; and</LINE>
	<LINE>as time is required for transmission between office</LINE>
	<LINE>and office, it must be borne in mind that if a telegram</LINE>
	<LINE>be deposited in a box at such a time that it cannot</LINE>
	<LINE>reach a Telegraph Office before 7 p.m., it may not</LINE>
	<LINE>reach its destination until after 8 a.m. on the follow-</LINE>
	<LINE>ing day. Postmasters may accept telegrams after the</LINE>
	<LINE>usual hours on payment of certain fees, provided that</LINE>
	<LINE>the terminal office is open, or, that the attention of</LINE>
	<LINE>that office can be gained.</LINE>
	<LINE>19. Telegrams written on the proper forms and</LINE>
	<LINE>properly prepaid may be handed to rural messengers,</LINE>
	<LINE>who are proceeding to telegraph offices.</LINE>
	<LINE>20. Numbers expressed in figures are counted</LINE>
	<LINE>as so many words, according to the number of</LINE>
	<LINE>figures employed. For example, " 7 " counts as</LINE>
	<LINE>one word, "12" as two words, "385" as three</LINE>
	<LINE>words; and so on. Fractions are counted accord-</LINE>
	<LINE>ing to the number of figures employed to ex-</LINE>
	<LINE>press the quantity, one word being added for the bar</LINE>
	<LINE>or mark of division between the numerator and de-</LINE>
	<LINE>nominator — thus "^"counts as three words, "f "</LINE>
	<LINE>as three words, "109f " as six words. In groups</LINE>
	<LINE>of figures intended to express time, any bar or stop</LINE>
	<LINE>is counted as one word ; thus, " |f " counts as five</LINE>
	<LINE>words. Ordinal numbers are charged in the same</LINE>
	<LINE>way as cardinal numbers, with the addition of one</LINE>
	<LINE>word for the affix st, rd, or th, as the case may be.</LINE>
	<LINE>21. When the sender of a telegram desires that</LINE>
	<LINE>special instructions, such as "private," "confiden-</LINE>
	<LINE>tial," "to be opened at once," or the like, shall be</LINE>
	<LINE>written on the envelope of the message, he must write</LINE>
	<LINE>the instructions immediately after the address of the</LINE>
	<LINE>person to whom the message is sent. These instruc-</LINE>
	<LINE>tions are charged for as part of the message.</LINE>
	<LINE>22. When telegrams are addressed to a Telegraph</LINE>
	<LINE>Office to be called for, they are kept for two clear</LINE>
	<LINE>days ; and if no application be made for them within</LINE>
	<LINE>that time, are sent to the Chief Office, London.</LINE>
	<LINE>23. Telegrams for the re-direction of letters are</LINE>
	<LINE>accepted at the ordinary rate of charge; but the</LINE>
	<LINE>sender must append his signature to the telegram,</LINE>
	<LINE>otherwise it cannot be acted upon.</LINE>
	<LINE>24. Telegrams which are indecently or obscenely</LINE>
	<LINE>worded, or which appear to contain abusive, libellous,</LINE>
	<LINE>or grossly offensive matter, will not be transmitted.</LINE>
	<LINE>25. The Department is not liable for losses in-</LINE>
	<LINE>curred through the incorrect transmission, delay, or</LINE>
	<LINE>non-delivery of telegrams.</LINE>
	<LINE>26. Telegraph offices are, as a rule, open from 8</LINE>
	<LINE>a.m. to 8 p.m. on week days, and from 8 a.m. to 10</LINE>
	<LINE>a.m. on Sundays. There are, however, offices in</LINE>
	<LINE>several of the larger towns which are open for longer</LINE>
	<LINE>periods. At the following offices in London and in</LINE>

	<LINE>weather one day in advance in any district not</LINE>
	<LINE>bordering on the Atlantic, can be obtained by tele-</LINE>
	<LINE>graph from the Meteorological Office on payment of</LINE>

	<LINE>PRIVATE WIRES.</LINE>
	<LINE>1. The Department undertakes to construct and</LINE>
	<LINE>afterwards maintain, upon the payment of an annual</LINE>
	<LINE>rental, a line of private wire between the place of</LINE>
	<LINE>business or residence of a firm or private individual</LINE>
	<LINE>and a Postal Telegraph Office, or between two or</LINE>
	<LINE>more places of business or residences. The advantage</LINE>
	<LINE>of having a private wire laid into a Postal Telegraph</LINE>
	<LINE>Office is that the renter is placed in direct communi-</LINE>
	<LINE>cation with the public wires to all parts of the king-</LINE>
	<LINE>dom or abroad, messages being received from and</LINE>
	<LINE>sent to the Postal Telegraph Office by wire instead of</LINE>
	<LINE>by hand.</LINE>

	<LINE>Greenwich mean time by electric current at either ten</LINE>
	<LINE>or one o'clock.</LINE>
	<LINE>3. AU applications or communications in regard</LINE>
	<LINE>to private wires or time signals should be addressed</LINE>
	<LINE>to "The Secretary, General Post Office, London, E.G."</LINE>

	<LINE>(Regulations founded upon the St. Petersburg</LINE>
	<LINE>Convention of 1875.)</LINE>
	<LINE>1. Foreign telegrams are divided into three classes</LINE>
	<LINE>— ordinary, code, and cypher. Ordinary telegrams</LINE>
	<LINE>are those composed of a series of words, or of words,</LINE>

	<LINE>2. Code telegrams are those composed of words,</LINE>
	<LINE>the context of which has no intelligible meaning.</LINE>
	<LINE>Proper names are not allowed in the text of code</LINE>
	<LINE>telegrams, except in their natural sense.</LINE>
	<LINE>3. Cypher telegrams are those containing series or</LINE>
	<LINE>groups of figures or letters having a secret meaning ;</LINE>
	<LINE>or words not to be found in a standard dictionary of</LINE>
	<LINE>the language. The portion in cypher must be com-</LINE>
	<LINE>posed exclusively of figures or exclusively of letters.</LINE>
	<LINE>Cypher telegrams written in letters are not accepted</LINE>
	<LINE>for Extra- Europe an places.</LINE>
	<LINE>4. The address of the receiver must be paid for,</LINE>
	<LINE>and in no case must the address consist of less than</LINE>
	<LINE>two words — a name and a town. Example — Her-</LINE>
	<LINE>cules, Bombay.</LINE>
	<LINE>5. The address of the sender is charged for if</LINE>
