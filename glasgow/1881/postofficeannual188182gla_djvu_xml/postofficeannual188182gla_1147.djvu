	<LINE>Eegistered letter envelopes, bearing a twopenny</LINE>
	<LINE>stamp embossed on the flap for the payment of the</LINE>
	<LINE>registration fee, are of five sizes, and are sold at the</LINE>
	<LINE>following prices: — 5;^ by 3J inches, and 6 by 3f</LINE>
	<LINE>inches, 2|d. each, or 2s. 2^d. per packet of twelve;</LINE>
	<LINE>8 by 6 inches, 2|d. each, or 2s. 7d. per packet of</LINE>
	<LINE>twelve ; 10 by 7^ inches, and 11 J by 6 inches, 3d.</LINE>
	<LINE>each, or 2s. lOd. per packet of twelve.</LINE>
	<LINE>Stamps should be placed on the front, that is, on</LINE>
	<LINE>the address side of the letter, and in the right hand</LINE>
	<LINE>upper corner. On re-directed letters care should be</LINE>
	<LINE>taken not to place fresh stamps over those which</LINE>
	<LINE>have been previously used.</LINE>
	<LINE>In affixing the stamps, the corner of the envelope</LINE>
	<LINE>and the gummed side of the stamp should be slightly</LINE>
	<LINE>wetted, and then the stamp should be gently pressed</LINE>
	<LINE>till it is firmly fixed. The practice of dipping the</LINE>
	<LINE>stamp in water is objectionable ; because, unless the</LINE>
	<LINE>stamp be immediately withdrawn, and care be taken,</LINE>
	<LINE>by the use of blotting paper or some other absorbent,</LINE>
	<LINE>to remove any excess of moisture, the gum may be</LINE>
	<LINE>washed ofl, or the stamp may be rubbed off the</LINE>
	<LINE>letter. By the use of envelopes bearing an embossed</LINE>
	<LINE>stamp (which can be obtained at any Post Office) all</LINE>
	<LINE>risk of the stamp being detached may be avoided.</LINE>
