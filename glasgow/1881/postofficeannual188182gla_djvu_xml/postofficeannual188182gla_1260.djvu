	<LINE>NEW BUSINESS in 1880, - -</LINE>
	<LINE>All profits divided among policyliolders. Policies indisputable alter three years from their date.</LINE>
	<LINE>THIS Society has for some years done the largest business of any ofBce in the world, and from</LINE>
	<LINE>the higher Rates of Interest that prevail in the United States upon the very best Securities,</LINE>
	<LINE>the SOCIETY is enabled to offer correspondingly greater advantages to its Policyholders than is in the</LINE>
	<LINE>power of Life Insurance Companies in this country, where the interest obtainable upon a similar class</LINE>
	<LINE>of investment is so much lower.</LINE>
	<LINE>The EQUITABLE Society has introduced a new form of Life Assurance, known as the</LINE>
	<LINE>TONTINE SAVINGS' FUND POLICY.</LINE>
	<LINE>On this plan the profits are divided at stated periods, viz., TEN, FIFTEEN, or TWENTY YEARS,</LINE>
	<LINE>which must be determined upon at time of entry. When the Assured's TONTINE period has arrived</LINE>
	<LINE>he becomes entitled to his share of the Accumulated Profits, and he is then given one of the following</LINE>
	<LINE>options : —</LINE>
	<LINE>First. — To taJce the cash value of his Policy.</LINE>
	<LINE>Second. — To take a paid up non-participating Policy for an equivalent of its cash value.</LINE>
	<LINE>Third. — A yearly increasing annuity and the original sum at death to his heirs.</LINE>
	<LINE>The following Table gives the results, as estimated, of a 20-year Policy taken out on the Tontine</LINE>
	<LINE>Savings' Fund plan of Assurance : —</LINE>

	<LINE>Thus, one aged 25, after 20 payments of £19 17s. 6d., may choose any of the three ways, viz., cash</LINE>
	<LINE>£600, and give up his Policy; a paid-up Policy for £1600; or an annuity of £19 4s. 2d., increasing</LINE>
	<LINE>yearly, and the £1000 at death to his heirs.</LINE>
