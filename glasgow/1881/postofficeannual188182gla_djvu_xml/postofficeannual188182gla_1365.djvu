	<LINE>THIS Society differs iii its principles from any other Office. Instead of charging rates higher</LINE>
	<LINE>than are necessary, and afterwards returning the excess in the shape of periodical Bonuses,</LINE>
	<LINE>it gives from the iirst as large an assurance as the Premiums will with safety bear — reserving</LINE>
	<LINE>the Whole Surplus for those Members who have lived long enough to secure the Common Fund</LINE>
	<LINE>from loss.</LINE>
	<LINE>A policy for £1200 to £1250 may thus at most ages be had for the Premium usually</LINE>
	<LINE>charged for £1000 only; while, by reserving the surplus, large additions have been</LINE>
	<LINE>given — and may be expected in the future — on the Policies of those who live to participate.</LINE>
	<LINE>It has taken a leading part in the Removal of Resteictions and Grounds of Challenge. The</LINE>
	<LINE>Rule was adopted in 1849 that error in the original statements did not involve forfeiture unless</LINE>
	<LINE>proved to be " fraudulent as well as untrue."</LINE>
	<LINE>Foreign Eesidence and Travel. — Members (not seafaring men) are free to reside in any part</LINE>
	<LINE>of the World to the north of 35° N. — Asia excepted — and to the south of 30° S. Licences for</LINE>
	<LINE>places beyond the free limits are given on favourable terms; and when an extra premium is</LINE>
	<LINE>charged it has the advantage, according to the equitable principle of the Office, of bringing the</LINE>
	<LINE>Assured sooner to share in Profits.</LINE>

	<LINE>Thus a person of 30 may secure £1000 at death, with Profits, for a yearly premium of £20 15s., which</LINE>
	<LINE>in the other Scottish Mutual Offices would assure £800 only.</LINE>
	<LINE>Or, if unwilling to burden himself with payments during the whole of life, he may secure a Policy for</LINE>
	<LINE>£1000 (with Profits) for a Premium of £27 13s. 4., limited to twenty-one payments^ being nearly the same</LINE>
	<LINE>as most Offices require during the whole of life.</LINE>
