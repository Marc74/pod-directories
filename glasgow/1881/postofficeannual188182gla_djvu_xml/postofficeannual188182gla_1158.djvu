	<LINE>POST OFFICE REGULATIONS.</LINE>
	<LINE>have direct Government security for the payment of</LINE>
	<LINE>the money at the proper time.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Post Office of Glasgow receives proposals</LINE>
	<LINE>for the insurance of lives and the purchase of</LINE>
	<LINE>annuities ; and forms of proposal, with full instruc-</LINE>
	<LINE>tions for filling up and delivering the same, as well</LINE>
	<LINE>as every other necessary information, may be obtained</LINE>
	<LINE>on application.</LINE>
	<LINE>POST OFFICE TELEGEAPHS.</LINE>
	<LINE>1 . The charge for telegrams throughout the United</LINE>
	<LINE>Kingdom is Is. for the first 20 words, and 3d. for</LINE>
	<LINE>every additional five words, or part of five words * ;</LINE>
	<LINE>the names and addresses of the sender and receiver not</LINE>
	<LINE>being counted.</LINE>
	<LINE>2. The charges for Press telegrams are Is. for</LINE>
	<LINE>every 100 words, or portion of 100 words, handed</LINE>
	<LINE>in between the hours of 6 p.m. and 9 a.m., and Is.</LINE>
	<LINE>for every 75 words, or portion of 75 words, handed in</LINE>
	<LINE>between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., with an</LINE>
	<LINE>additional charge of 2d. per 100, or 2d. per 75 words,</LINE>
	<LINE>as the case may be, for the same telegram to every</LINE>
	<LINE>additional address.</LINE>
	<LINE>3. Distinctive stamps of the value of ^d., Id.,</LINE>
	<LINE>3d., 4d., 6d., Is., 3s., 5s., 10s., £1, and £5, are</LINE>
	<LINE>isused for the payment of the charges on telegram?.</LINE>
	<LINE>Postage stamps are not accepted in payment of tele-</LINE>
	<LINE>grams, nor are telegraph stamps accepted in payment</LINE>
	<LINE>of postage. Telegraph stamps are not purchased</LINE>
	<LINE>from the public at Post Offices, nor can they be ex-</LINE>
	<LINE>changed for postage stamps. The public are required</LINE>
	<LINE>to affix the stamps to the message forms just as they</LINE>
	<LINE>are required to affix stamps to letters.</LINE>
	<LINE>4. Receipts for the charges on telegrams can be</LINE>
	<LINE>obtained at a cost of 2d. each.</LINE>
	<LINE>5. The inland telegram forms are of two kinds,</LINE>
	<LINE>namely, the "A 1 " form, embossed with a stamp of</LINE>
	<LINE>the value of Is., and the " A " form (given gratis),</LINE>
	<LINE>with no stamp embossed thereon. The " A 1 forms "</LINE>
	<LINE>may be purchased singly or in any number. They</LINE>
	<LINE>may also be had bound up into books of 20 forms ;</LINE>
	<LINE>price 20s. 2d. per book.</LINE>
	<LINE>6. When the terminal office, i.e., the office situated</LINE>
	<LINE>nearest to the address, is a Head Post Office, the</LINE>
	<LINE>amount paid for transmission covers the cost of de-</LINE>
	<LINE>livery within one mile, or within the town postal</LINE>
	<LINE>delivery of that office when the delivery extends more</LINE>
	<LINE>than a mile. But when it is not a Head Post Office,</LINE>
	<LINE>the message is delivered free within a limit of</LINE>
	<LINE>one mile only.</LINE>
	<LINE>7. When the addressee resides beyond the free</LINE>
	<LINE>delivery, porterage is charged at the rate of 6d. per</LINE>
	<LINE>mile, or part thereof, provided the whole distance to</LINE>
	<LINE>be traversed does not exceed three miles; but the</LINE>
	<LINE>charge is calculated from the boundary of the district</LINE>
	<LINE>within which no porterage is levied. For instance,</LINE>
	<LINE>if the addressee's residence is a mile and a quarter</LINE>
	<LINE>from the terminal office, and also beyond the town</LINE>
	<LINE>postal delivery, the charge for porterage would be 6d.;</LINE>
	<LINE>if the distance is above two miles and under three. Is.</LINE>
	<LINE>8. If the addressee resides at a greater distance</LINE>
	<LINE>than three miles from the terminal office, porterage</LINE>
	<LINE>is charged for delivery by mounted messenger at the</LINE>
	<LINE>rate of Is. per mile, except in Ireland, where the</LINE>
	<LINE>charge usually is 8d. per mile. The charge being</LINE>
	<LINE>reckoned I'rom the Office door.</LINE>
	<LINE>* A similar interpretation is to be put upon tlie phrase</LINE>
	<LINE>" every additional — words," wherever such phrase occurs.</LINE>
	<LINE>9. If the sender requires his telegram to be for-</LINE>
	<LINE>warded by post or by train from the terminal office,</LINE>
	<LINE>he must write the words "by post" or "by train"</LINE>
	<LINE>at the end of the address of the person to whom it</LINE>
	<LINE>is to be sent, and in the latter case he must deposit</LINE>
	<LINE>Is. to cover the cost of conveyance.</LINE>
	<LINE>10. A deposit of 5s. is required upon all telegrams</LINE>
	<LINE>addressed to persons on board ship (unless the ship</LINE>
	<LINE>be lying along side a wharf, jetty, or pier) to cover</LINE>
	<LINE>any expense incurred in their delivery; but applica^</LINE>
	<LINE>tion can be made to the Secretary for any surplus.</LINE>
	<LINE>Such application should be made within three months.</LINE>
	<LINE>11. An embossed stamp which has been removed</LINE>
	<LINE>from a spoiled and unused " A 1 " fonn will be</LINE>
	<LINE>accepted in payment of a telegram ; but mutilated</LINE>
	<LINE>or defaced stamps will not.</LINE>
	<LINE>12. The sender should avoid all words not strictly</LINE>
	<LINE>necessary in his address. He is not obliged to have</LINE>
	<LINE>his address telegraphed, but he should furnish it to</LINE>
	<LINE>enable the Department to communicate with him, if</LINE>
	<LINE>necessary. When the address is not to be telegraphed,</LINE>
	<LINE>it should be written at the foot or on the back of</LINE>
	<LINE>the form.</LINE>
	<LINE>13. Telegrams can be repeated at the request of</LINE>
	<LINE>the sender, if he desires to adopt this security against</LINE>
	<LINE>risk of error, by being signalled back from each</LINE>
	<LINE>office at which they are received to the office from</LINE>
	<LINE>which they are forwarded. The charge for repeti-</LINE>
	<LINE>tion is one half the ordinary tariff; fractions of</LINE>
	<LINE>threepence being reckoned as twopence.</LINE>
	<LINE>14. The cost of a reply not exceeding forty words</LINE>
	<LINE>in length may be prepaid ; and a reply form will then</LINE>
	<LINE>be delivered to the addressee, who will be at liberty</LINE>
	<LINE>to send his reply, from any Telegraph Office, at any</LINE>
	<LINE>time within two months after the date of the original</LINE>
	<LINE>telegram. If the form be not used application for the</LINE>
	<LINE>return of the money, accompanied by the form, may</LINE>
	<LINE>be made by the holder to the secretary. General Post</LINE>
	<LINE>Office, London. A reply form, however, need not</LINE>
	<LINE>necessarily be used for the reply to a message, but may</LINE>
	<LINE>be used for the purpose of prepaying a message con-</LINE>
	<LINE>taining the same number of words as that named</LINE>
	<LINE>on it.</LINE>
	<LINE>15. Telegrams re-transmitted to a second address</LINE>
	<LINE>by wire or pneumatic tube are liable to additional</LINE>
	<LINE>charge at the ordinary Inland rate. No charge is</LINE>
	<LINE>made for the second service, if the re-direction does</LINE>
	<LINE>not involve any use of the wires or tubes. In addition</LINE>
	<LINE>to the amount chargeable on each re-transmitted</LINE>
	<LINE>telegram, a fee of £1 Is, per annum is charged for</LINE>
	<LINE>the registration of special instructions as to the re-</LINE>
	<LINE>direction of telegrams after office hours. Removals</LINE>
	<LINE>are registered, when this is specially requested, for a</LINE>
	<LINE>period of one month ; and no charge is made for the</LINE>
	<LINE>registration.</LINE>
	<LINE>16. Persons who wish to avoid sending so far as</LINE>
	<LINE>to a telegraph office, may, without additional charge,</LINE>
	<LINE>post a telegram form enclosed in an envelope, addressed</LINE>
	<LINE>" Telegraph Office," in a wall or pillar box, or in the</LINE>
	<LINE>letter-box of a Receiving Office or Sub-Office. Tele-</LINE>
	<LINE>grams so posted are sent to the nearest Postal</LINE>
	<LINE>Telegraph Office by the first collection from the</LINE>
	<LINE>letter-box in which they are deposited, and are then</LINE>
	<LINE>transmitted by wire as soon as possible. Care should</LINE>
	<LINE>be taken that such telegrams are fully prepaid.</LINE>
	<LINE>17. Telegrams so posted, but insufficiently prepaid,</LINE>
	<LINE>are forwarded to their destination, the difference of</LINE>
	<LINE>charge being obtained from the addressee. Unpaid</LINE>
