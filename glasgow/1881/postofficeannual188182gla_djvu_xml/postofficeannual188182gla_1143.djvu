	<LINE>singly or in a packet, the postage, when prepaid, is</LINE>
	<LINE>one halfpenny ; but a packet containing two or more</LINE>
	<LINE>registered newspapers is not chargeable with a higher</LINE>
	<LINE>rate of postage than would be chargeable on a book</LINE>
	<LINE>packet of the same weight, viz., one halfpenny for</LINE>
	<LINE>every 2 oz. or part of that weight.</LINE>
	<LINE>5. A newspaper posted unpaid, or a packet of</LINE>
	<LINE>newspapers posted either unpaid, or insufficiently paid,</LINE>

	<LINE>hesive stamp, or by the use of a stamped wrapper.</LINE>

	<LINE>8. Every newspaper must be posted either without</LINE>
	<LINE>a cover, or in a cover entirely open at both ends, so</LINE>
	<LINE>as to admit of easy removal for examination.* A</LINE>
	<LINE>newspaper must not be fastened in its cover by means</LINE>
	<LINE>of gum, sealing wax, postage stamp, or otherwise. If</LINE>
	<LINE>this rule be infringed, the newspaper is treated as a</LINE>
	<LINE>letter.</LINE>
	<LINE>9. Every newspaper must be so folded as to admit</LINE>
	<LINE>of the title being readily seen.</LINE>
	<LINE>10. A newspaper, or packet of newspapers, which</LINE>
	<LINE>contains any enclosure except supplements, is charged</LINE>
	<LINE>as a letter, unless the enclosure be such as might be</LINE>
	<LINE>sent at the book rate of postage, and the entire</LINE>
	<LINE>packet be sufficiently prepaid as a book packet, in</LINE>
	<LINE>which case it is allowed to pass.</LINE>
	<LINE>11. A newspaper which has any letter, or any</LINE>
	<LINE>communication of the nature of a letter, written in it</LINE>
	<LINE>or upon its cover, is charged as an unpaid or insuffi-</LINE>
	<LINE>ciently paid letter.]</LINE>
	<LINE>12. No packet of newspapers may be above 14</LINE>
	<LINE>lbs. in weight, nor above two feet in length, one foot</LINE>

	<LINE>(3.) Inland Book Post.</LINE>

	<LINE>part of that weight.</LINE>
	<LINE>2. A packet posted wholly unpaid is charged with</LINE>
	<LINE>double the book-postage ; and if posted partially pre-</LINE>
	<LINE>paid, with double the deficiency.</LINE>
	<LINE>3. A book-packet may contain any number of separ-</LINE>
	<LINE>ate books or other publications, photographs (when</LINE>
	<LINE>not on glass, or in cases containing glass or any like</LINE>
	<LINE>substance), drawings, prints, or maps, and any quan-</LINE>
	<LINE>tity of paper, or any other substance in ordinary use</LINE>
	<LINE>for writing or printing upon ; and the books or other</LINE>
	<LINE>publications, prints, maps, &amp;c., may be either printed,</LINE>
	<LINE>* In order that no failure may occur in the delivery of</LINE>
	<LINE>newspapers through the covers hecoming detached, it is</LINE>
	<LINE>recommended that the addresses he -written on exposed</LINE>
	<LINE>parts of the newspapers themselves as well as on the</LINE>
	<LINE>covers.</LINE>
	<LINE>written, engraved, lithographed, or plain, or any mix-</LINE>
	<LINE>ture of these. Further, all legitimate binding, mount-</LINE>
	<LINE>ing, or covering of a book, &amp;c., or of a portion^ thereof,</LINE>
	<LINE>is allowed, whether such binding, &amp;c., be loose or</LINE>
	<LINE>attached ; as also rollers in the case of prints or</LINE>
	<LINE>maps, markers (whether of paper or otherwise) in</LINE>
	<LINE>the case of books, pens or pencils in the case of</LINE>
	<LINE>pocket-books, &amp;c., and, in short, whatever is neces-</LINE>
	<LINE>sary for the safe transmission of such articles, or</LINE>
	<LINE>usually appertains thereto ; but the binding, rollers,</LINE>
	<LINE>&amp;c., must not be sent as a separate packet.</LINE>
	<LINE>Circulars — i.e., letters which, from internal evi-</LINE>
	<LINE>dence, appear to be intended for transmission in</LINE>
	<LINE>identical terms to several persons, and the whole or</LINE>
	<LINE>greater part of which is produced by means of ordinary</LINE>
	<LINE>type, engraving, lithography, or any other mechanical</LINE>
	<LINE>process — may also be sent by book post.</LINE>
	<LINE>4. But a book-packet may not contain any letter,</LINE>
	<LINE>or communication of the nature of a letterf (whether</LINE>
	<LINE>separate or otherwise), unless it be a circular letter;</LINE>
	<LINE>nor any enclosure sealed or in any way closed against</LINE>
	<LINE>inspection ; nor any other enclosure not allowed by</LINE>
	<LINE>Eule 3. If this Rule be infringed, the entire packet</LINE>
	<LINE>is charged as a letter. J</LINE>
	<LINE>5. A book-packet may be posted either without a</LINE>
	<LINE>cover (in which case it must not be fastened, whether</LINE>
	<LINE>by means of gum, wafer, sealing wax, postage stamp,</LINE>
	<LINE>or otherwise), or in a cover entirely open at both</LINE>
	<LINE>ends, so as to admit of the contents being easily with-</LINE>
	<LINE>drawn for examination ; § otherwise it is treated as a</LINE>
	<LINE>letter. For the greater security of the contents,</LINE>
	<LINE>however, it may be tied at the ends with string;</LINE>
	<LINE>postmasters being authorized to cut the string in</LINE>
	<LINE>such case, although if they do so they must again tie</LINE>
	<LINE>up the packet.</LINE>
	<LINE>6. No Book-packet may be above 5 lbs. in weight,</LINE>
	<LINE>nor above 1 ft. 6 in. in length, 9 in. in width, or 6 in. in</LINE>
	<LINE>depth, unless it be sent to or from one of the Govern-</LINE>
	<LINE>ment Offices.</LINE>
	<LINE>7. When, owing to a great and unusual influx of</LINE>
	<LINE>letters, books, &amp;c., the transmission or delivery of the</LINE>
	<LINE>letters would be delayed if the whole mail were dealt</LINE>
	<LINE>with without distinction, book-packets may be kept</LINE>
	<LINE>back till the next despatch, or delivery.</LINE>
	<LINE>(4.) Abuse of the Book Post.</LINE>
	<LINE>It wiU be seen from the foregoing rules, that</LINE>
	<LINE>there is no legal way of sending a letter, other</LINE>
	<LINE>than a circular letter, through the post for a postage</LINE>
	<LINE>of a halfpenny, except by means of a post card.</LINE>
	<LINE>It must not be supposed that, because a post</LINE>
	<LINE>card, which is open to inspection, may have a letter</LINE>
	<LINE>written or printed upon it, any card whatever, and</LINE>
	<LINE>even any piece of paper, if only it be placed in an open</LINE>
	<LINE>wrapper, may be sent through the post with a letter</LINE>
	<LINE>written or printed upon it for a postage of a halfpenny.</LINE>
	<LINE>It is well, therefore, to explain for the guidance of</LINE>
	<LINE>the public —</LINE>
	<LINE>1. That the letter-rate of postage must be prepaid</LINE>
	<LINE>for any communication of the nature of a letter.</LINE>
	<LINE>t Entries merely stating who sends the book, &amp;c., or</LINE>
	<LINE>to whom it is given, are not regarded as a letter.</LINE>
	<LINE>% It is the duty of Postmasters, whenever they have</LINE>
	<LINE>ground for suspecting an infringement of any of the</LINE>
	<LINE>above conditions, and occasionally even when there is</LINE>
	<LINE>no ground for suspicion, to open and examine book-</LINE>
	<LINE>packets posted at, or passing through, their office.</LINE>
	<LINE>g In order to secure the return of book-packets which</LINE>
	<LINE>cannot be delivered, the names and addresses of the</LINE>
	<LINE>senders shovild be printed or written outside; thus "From</LINE>
