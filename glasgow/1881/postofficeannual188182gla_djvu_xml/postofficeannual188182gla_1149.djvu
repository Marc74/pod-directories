	<LINE>POST OfFICE REGULATIONS.</LINE>
	<LINE>25</LINE>
	<LINE>10. When a letter is sent to a place where there is</LINE>
	<LINE>only a Sub-office, the name of the Head Office should</LINE>
	<LINE>be added to the address. Letters posted iu one part of</LINE>
	<LINE>the United Kingdom and intended for another (as,</LINE>
	<LINE>for example, letters posted in England and intended</LINE>
	<LINE>for Scotland) should have the name of the Country</LINE>
	<LINE>to which they are sent added to the address, unless</LINE>
	<LINE>the letters be intended for either London, Glasgow,</LINE>
	<LINE>Edinburgh, Dublin, or other very large towns, when</LINE>
	<LINE>such addition is unnecessary.</LINE>
	<LINE>1 1. The number, too, of the house should appear ;</LINE>
	<LINE>its omission being a cause of delay in the sorting ;</LINE>
	<LINE>and tending to retard the general delivery. In the</LINE>
	<LINE>case of letters for places abroad, the name of the</LINE>
	<LINE>country as well as the town should be given in full,</LINE>
	<LINE>and should be the last word in the address. Atten-</LINE>
	<LINE>tion to this latter precaution will often assist in</LINE>
	<LINE>deciphering the name of a town, and prevent the</LINE>
	<LINE>letter from being mis-sent when there are towns of</LINE>
	<LINE>the same name in different countries. For example:</LINE>
	<LINE>a letter intended for London in Western Canada, but</LINE>
	<LINE>simply addressed " London, W.C.," would be for-</LINE>
	<LINE>warded to the Western Central District of the</LINE>
	<LINE>Metropolis in England.</LINE>
	<LINE>12. Letters for well-known firms and persons in</LINE>
	<LINE>Glasgow are sometimes addressed " Glasgow" only;</LINE>
	<LINE>but this practice often causes delay in their delivery.</LINE>
	<LINE>Letters for strangers or for person whose address is</LINE>
	<LINE>not known at the Chief Office, simply addressed</LINE>
	<LINE>" Glasgow " (and not " Post Office," or " Poste</LINE>
	<LINE>Eestante, Glasgow,") are not delivered from the</LINE>
	<LINE>Poste Eestante, but are sent to the Returned Letter</LINE>
	<LINE>Office.</LINE>
	<LINE>13. A letter addressed to a Post Office to be</LINE>
	<LINE>called for is retained one month; and if not</LINE>
	<LINE>called for by the end of that time, is sent to the</LINE>
	<LINE>Returned Letter Office to be sent back to the</LINE>
	<LINE>writer. But if the letter be addressed to a Post</LINE>
	<LINE>Office at a seaport town for a person on board a</LINE>
	<LINE>ship expected to arrive at that port, it is kept three</LINE>
	<LINE>months.</LINE>
	<LINE>14. Letters addressed to initials or to fictitious</LINE>
	<LINE>names at Provincial Post Offices are not taken in,</LINE>
	<LINE>but are at once sent to the Returned Letter Office.</LINE>
	<LINE>15. All letters addressed to club houses, hotels,</LINE>
	<LINE>and other places where letters are received to be</LINE>
	<LINE>called for, should be returned to the. Post Office as</LINE>
	<LINE>soon as it has become evident that they will not be</LINE>
	<LINE>called for.</LINE>
	<LINE>16. Every letter should contain the full address of</LINE>
	<LINE>the writer, in order to ensure its return to him if the</LINE>
	<LINE>person to whom it is directed cannot be found. A</LINE>
	<LINE>much larger portion of the undelivered letters could</LINE>
	<LINE>be returned if the names and addresses of the senders</LINE>
	<LINE>were always either fully and plainly written inside,</LINE>
	<LINE>or embossed on the envelopes.</LINE>
	<LINE>17. To facilitate the delivery of letters, a letter-</LINE>
	<LINE>box should be affixed to every house-door.</LINE>
	<LINE>18. All letters, &amp;c., should be posted as early in</LINE>
	<LINE>the day as practicable, especially when sent in large</LINE>
	<LINE>numbers, as is frequently the case with newspapers</LINE>
	<LINE>and circulars, and care should always be taken to see</LINE>
	<LINE>that the packet falls into the letter-box, and does not |</LINE>
	<LINE>stick in its passage. This is especially important in</LINE>
	<LINE>the case of letters posted in pillar letter boxes, be-</LINE>
	<LINE>cause, though these receptacles are not intended nor</LINE>
	<LINE>designed for the reception of books, pamphlets, news-</LINE>
	<LINE>papers, or other bulky packets, injudicious or ignorant</LINE>
	<LINE>people do sometimes choke them with such articles.</LINE>
	<LINE>Much trouble is saved to the office if circulars, before</LINE>
	<LINE>being posted, are tied in bundles with all the</LINE>
	<LINE>addresses in one direction. Correspondence posted</LINE>
	<LINE>early in the day not only obtains in many cases the</LINE>
	<LINE>advantage of an earlier delivery, but frequently avoids</LINE>
	<LINE>the risk of delay from irregularity in the working of</LINE>
	<LINE>the trains.</LINE>
	<LINE>1 9. The practice of sealing with wax letters pass-</LINE>
	<LINE>ing to and from the East and West Indies, and other</LINE>
	<LINE>countries with hot climates, is attended with much</LINE>
	<LINE>inconvenience, and frequently with serious injury, not</LINE>
	<LINE>only to the letters so sealed, but to the other letters</LINE>
	<LINE>in the mail, from the melting of the wax and adhesion</LINE>
	<LINE>of the letters to each other. The public are therefore</LINE>
	<LINE>recommended, in all such cases, to use either wafers</LINE>
	<LINE>or gum, and to advise their correspondents in the</LINE>
	<LINE>countries referred to, to do the same.</LINE>
	<LINE>20. Any person who, on receiving a surcharged</LINE>
	<LINE>letter, has reason to think that it has been wrongly</LINE>
	<LINE>taxed, should take it, before it has been opened, to</LINE>
	<LINE>the Post Office to be weighed, and if it then appear</LINE>
	<LINE>that it does not turn the scale, should have its exact</LINE>
	<LINE>weight certified in writing. This will in most cases</LINE>
	<LINE>be sufficient evidence that the letter has been errone-</LINE>
	<LINE>ously charged ; though sometimes, owing to the paper</LINE>
	<LINE>being damp when it is posted, a packet weighs more</LINE>
	<LINE>then than when it is delivered ; and it is the weight</LINE>
	<LINE>at the time of posting that determines the charge.</LINE>
	<LINE>21. When complaint is made of a letter or other</LINE>
	<LINE>postal packet being lost, missent, or delayed, infor-</LINE>
	<LINE>mation, as precise as possible, regarding all the facts</LINE>
	<LINE>of the case should be furnished, together with any</LINE>
	<LINE>documents that may throw light upon the matter.</LINE>
	<LINE>The day and hour at which the letter, &amp;c., was</LINE>
	<LINE>posted, as well as the office at which and the person</LINE>
	<LINE>by whom this was done, should always be stated ;</LINE>
	<LINE>and when possible, the cover or wrapper in an entire</LINE>
	<LINE>state should be sent, in order that the place of delay</LINE>
	<LINE>may be ascertained by an examination of the stamps.</LINE>
	<LINE>22. Neither money nor any other article of con-</LINE>
	<LINE>siderable value ought ever to be sent through the</LINE>
	<LINE>post, except by means of a money order or in a</LINE>
	<LINE>registered letter. Any person who sends money or</LINE>
	<LINE>jewellery in an unregistered letter, not only runs a</LINE>
	<LINE>risk of losing his property, but exposes to tempta-</LINE>
	<LINE>tion every one through whose hands his letter passes,</LINE>
	<LINE>and may be the means of ultimately bringing some</LINE>
	<LINE>clerk or letter carrier to moral ruin. Every letter</LINE>
	<LINE>which contains money, postage stamps, or other</LINE>
	<LINE>valuable articles even when registered, ought to be</LINE>
	<LINE>enclosed in one of the special registered envelopes</LINE>
	<LINE>supplied by the Post Office in order to obtain the</LINE>
	<LINE>benefit of the guarantee described at page 21.</LINE>
	<LINE>23. Whenever Bank Notes are sent by post, even</LINE>
	<LINE>in registered letters, they ought to be cut in halves,</LINE>
	<LINE>and the second halves should not be posted till it has</LINE>
	<LINE>been ascertained that the first halves has been</LINE>
	<LINE>received ; and further, in order to afford the means</LINE>
	<LINE>of identification, a memorandum should always be</LINE>
	<LINE>made of the number of each bank note.</LINE>
	<LINE>23a Care should be taken, when crossing cheques,</LINE>
	<LINE>to make the lines so distinct that they cannot be</LINE>
	<LINE>erased without betraying the erasure.</LINE>
	<LINE>24. Except where the Surveyor may deem a</LINE>
	<LINE>interval necessary, late letters,* &amp;c., are</LINE>
	<LINE>* "Late Letters" are such as are posted after the</LINE>
	<LINE>ordinary time, and cannot be sent forward by the mail</LINE>
	<LINE>then in preparation, unless extra payment be made.</LINE>
