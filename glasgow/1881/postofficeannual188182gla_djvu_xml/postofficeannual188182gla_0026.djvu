	<LINE>PREFACE.</LINE>
	<LINE>The arrangement of the present issue of the Glasgow Post-Office Directory is</LINE>
	<LINE>similar to that of last year. The Banking Houses, and Carriers' Quarters, with hours</LINE>
	<LINE>of departure, instead of being in the Appendix, have been placed near the front of</LINE>
	<LINE>General Directory (see pages 31 to 47).</LINE>
	<LINE>The General Directory includes Crosshill, Govanhill, Polmadie, PoUokshields East,</LINE>
	<LINE>Pollokshields West, Kinning Park, Partick, Hillhead, Kelvinside, Possilpark, White -</LINE>
	<LINE>inch, and Springburn.</LINE>
	<LINE>Bearsden and Bothwell have for the first time been given in the Suburban</LINE>
	<LINE>Directory.</LINE>
	<LINE>In the Street Directory (pages 565 to 788) the names of the intersecting</LINE>
	<LINE>streets are given in ordinary type, and the number affixed to the name of the Street</LINE>
	<LINE>denotes the Municipal or Parliamentary Ward ; and where a Street is divided into several</LINE>
	<LINE>Wards, such as Buchanan Street, the numbers belonging to each Ward are given at</LINE>
	<LINE>the top, viz. : from 1 to 275 are in Ward 8, from 2 to 210 in Ward 7, from 220 to</LINE>
	<LINE>314 in Ward 5, and from 283 to 295 are in Ward 10. It is hoped that this arrange-</LINE>
	<LINE>ment will facilitate the finding of the Ward in any Street of the Qity.</LINE>
	<LINE>At pages 53 to 74 the names of the Streets are given with reference to their</LINE>
	<LINE>situation, and the number affixed to each Street indicates the Eegistration district,</LINE>
	<LINE>while the Italic letters prefixed to the name of each Street, Square, or Place, shows</LINE>
	<LINE>its position on the Large Map, which has been traced in Half-mile Squares, with</LINE>
	<LINE>similar letters on the margin at each side. Thus to find out Montgomery Crescent,</LINE>
	<LINE>marked B a, take the line B from top or bottom, and the line a from the sides, and</LINE>
	<LINE>trace till they meet, and Avithin that square the place wanted will be found. To</LINE>
	<LINE>find College Station, marked G^ e on list, take G from top or bottom, and e from side,</LINE>
	<LINE>and trace in a similar way, and the Station will be found within the Half-mile</LINE>
	<LINE>Square where G and e meet.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Map has been revised to date by John Bartholomew, Esq., showing the New</LINE>
	<LINE>Tramway Lines and other Improvements, and Is again placed at the end of the Directory.</LINE>
