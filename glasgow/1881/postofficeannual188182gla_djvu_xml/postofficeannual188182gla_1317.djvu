	<LINE>The Coffee Plant, " Coffea Arahica " of Linnaeus, is an evergreen, and, as may be inferred from its scientific</LINE>
	<LINE>name, is a native of Arabia. It produces a pulpy berry about the size of a small cherry, inclosing two seeds,</LINE>
	<LINE>which, separated from their pulpy envelope,form the well known Coflfee beans of commerce. It may be remarked</LINE>
	<LINE>as a singular fact, in reference to Coffee, that while all of the vegetable kingdom that have been taken under</LINE>
	<LINE>the care of man have been improved, it alone asserts its independence ; for although cultivation may greatly</LINE>
	<LINE>enlarge the crop, it as certainly at the same time deteriorates the flavour, and the produce of the wild plant</LINE>
	<LINE>still maintains the highest figure in the market. It is well known that Coffee would be of no real value</LINE>
	<LINE>were it not properly roasted — a process which, as it requires much skill, is only to be acquired by experience.</LINE>
	<LINE>How man became acquainted with the fact that the tasteless seeds of a berry, when roasted, ground, and</LINE>
	<LINE>infused, would form a grateful beverage, will most probably remain a secret to the end of time. That the</LINE>
	<LINE>development of its useful properties depends wholly upon the roasting, is evident. About two hundred</LINE>
	<LINE>years ago Coffee was first introduced into England, since which its consumption has steadily increased, and</LINE>
	<LINE>deservedly so, when its medical properties are considered, it having been found useful in headaches arising</LINE>
	<LINE>from a particular state of the stomach, and much benefit having been derived from its exhibition in cases</LINE>
	<LINE>of asthma.</LINE>
	<LINE>A French scientific gentleman, who has directed his attention to this subject, says : — " I have found that</LINE>
	<LINE>Coffee is better roasted, and more of the aroma retained, when a double cylinder is used — the air between</LINE>
	<LINE>the interior and exterior cylinders acting as a non-conductor of heat. It is done more uniformly, while</LINE>
	<LINE>the essential oil on which the aroma depends is less liable to be dispersed than when exposed to the fierce</LINE>
	<LINE>heat of a fire in a single cylinder."</LINE>
	<LINE>In the double rotatory globular method of roasting as practised at Mr. Minto's Works, Graeme Street,</LINE>
	<LINE>Glasgow, the above principle is acted upon, inasmuch as the globe (which has superseded the cylinder since</LINE>
	<LINE>the application of steam-power to this branch) revolves in a medium of heated air, which, experience has</LINE>
	<LINE>shown, best prevents the dispersion of the essential oil, or aroma.</LINE>
