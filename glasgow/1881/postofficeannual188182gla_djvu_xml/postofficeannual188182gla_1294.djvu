	<LINE>good maps of the great coloEies, and the different divisions of the United States ; maps of India, as divided</LINE>
	<LINE>by Presidencies ; a separate map of Burmah, and another of Japan ; and, in short, just those additional</LINE>
	<LINE>maps for which one is always searching. The atlas also contains fourteen maps of classical geography and</LINE>
	<LINE>sixteen of historical geography, of -which one, illuttratirg the rise of the British Empire in India, is quite</LINE>
	<LINE>new to us." — Spectator.</LINE>
	<LINE>" Although maps of several parts of the ■world quickly become obsolete, it is not often that an entirely</LINE>
	<LINE>new atlas appears, probably on account of the great expense involved in its preparation. When, therefore,</LINE>
	<LINE>a work of this kind is undertaken, it may he expected to justify its existence by fulness of information and</LINE>
	<LINE>excellence of workmanship. The atlas before us may be said to withstand the test here indicated. The</LINE>
	<LINE>' International Atlas ' seems likely to achieve considerable success." — Times.</LINE>
	<LINE>" For all purposes of ready reference, as ■well as for study, the work will be found exceedingly useful. As</LINE>
	<LINE>a test of the careful revision by which the work has been brought down to date, the map of Turkey in</LINE>
	<LINE>Europe may be examined ; and it will be seen that all recent political alterations and settlements of</LINE>
	<LINE>boundary are plainly shown, so that Turkey is here seen as she now exists." — Daily Telegraph.</LINE>
