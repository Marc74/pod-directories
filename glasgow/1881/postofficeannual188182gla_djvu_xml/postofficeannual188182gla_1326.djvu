	<LINE>The "Ejector- Condenser" produces a full vacuum without an Air Pump, in all kinds of</LINE>
	<LINE>Steam Engines and Steam Pumps, and when applied to existing Non-Condensing Engines, gives</LINE>
	<LINE>a saving of 25 to 50 per cent, of fuel, or an equivalent increase of power; and for Winding</LINE>
	<LINE>Engines this is the only safe Condenser in use, the vacuum is constant, whether the engines are</LINE>
	<LINE>at rest or in motion, and many are working with great success. These apparatus, from their</LINE>
	<LINE>saving in fuel alone, very soon pay their own cost.</LINE>
