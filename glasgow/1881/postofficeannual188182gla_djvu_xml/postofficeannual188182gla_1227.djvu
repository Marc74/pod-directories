	<LINE>250 Renfrew Street.</LINE>
	<LINE>The objects of this Institution are to induce women</LINE>
	<LINE>of high character to devote themselves to the work of</LINE>
	<LINE>nursing the sick, to educate them for their work, and</LINE>
	<LINE>employ them either to nurse patients in the Estab-</LINE>
	<LINE>lishment or at their residences. The Home in Renfrew</LINE>
	<LINE>Street has been so arranged as to provide suitable</LINE>
	<LINE>accommodation for the ladies in charge and for 20</LINE>
	<LINE>nurses, ,7 rooms for private patients, and 2 wards</LINE>
	<LINE>with beds for 10 patients, a waiting room, a parlour</LINE>
	<LINE>for convalescents and other necessary conveniences.</LINE>
	<LINE>Persons desirous of being admitted into the Home</LINE>
	<LINE>can receive board, lodging, medical attendance, and</LINE>
	<LINE>nursing, either in private rooms, or in the public wards,</LINE>
	<LINE>on terms which may be learned by applying to the</LINE>
	<LINE>lady superintendent ; and they may be attended either</LINE>
	<LINE>by the physicians and surgeons attached to the Insti-</LINE>
	<LINE>tution, or by their own medical advisers. In the latter</LINE>
	<LINE>case, however, the fees of the medical advisers form</LINE>
	<LINE>an additional charge. Persons suffering from infec-</LINE>
	<LINE>tious disorders are not admitted into the Home, but</LINE>
	<LINE>may be attended at their private residences by nurses</LINE>
