	<LINE>OF</LINE>
	<LINE>(Fw list of Managers, Medical Officers, and other particulars, see page 120 in the Appendix).</LINE>
	<LINE>STATEMENT AND APPEAL.</LINE>
	<LINE>I. The Western Infirmary was opened in the beginning of November, 1874, and conclusive</LINE>
	<LINE>evidence has since been afforded that the wants of the community urgently required this</LINE>
	<LINE>additional Hospital.</LINE>
	<LINE>II. The cost of maintaining the Western Infirmary has hitherto been upwards of £11,000</LINE>
	<LINE>per annum, but extensive additions to the Institution are being made under the bequest by the</LINE>
	<LINE>late John Freeland, Esq., of Nice. This extension is nearly completed, and when the Hospital</LINE>
	<LINE>is fully occupied, the annual cost for maintenance will be about £20,000. Looking to the</LINE>
	<LINE>number of patients waiting to avail themselves of this additional accommodation, and the urgency</LINE>
	<LINE>of the cases, the Managers cannot doubt that the appeal which they now make for increased</LINE>
	<LINE>funds will meet with a satisfactory response.</LINE>
	<LINE>III. The Managers take the liberty of drawing attention to the subjoined Form of Bequest, in</LINE>
	<LINE>the hope that from that source they may be enabled gradually to accumulate a special fund from</LINE>
	<LINE>the investment of which, in so far as it is not required for contingencies, a considerable sup-</LINE>
	<LINE>plementary revenue may in time be derived.</LINE>
