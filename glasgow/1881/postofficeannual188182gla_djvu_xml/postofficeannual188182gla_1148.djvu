	<LINE>C. In order to prevent the temptation to steal</LINE>
	<LINE>stamps attached to letters, which might be afforded</LINE>
	<LINE>by facilities for selling them, no separate stamps can</LINE>
	<LINE>be purchased. They must in all cases be presented</LINE>
	<LINE>in strips of not less than two.</LINE>
	<LINE>7. In consequence of representations made to the</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Office by various firms, that there is reason to</LINE>
	<LINE>bslieve that their postage stamps were purloined by</LINE>
	<LINE>persons in their employ, the Department has recom-</LINE>
	<LINE>mended that the name or initials of firms, &amp;c., be</LINE>
	<LINE>either printed on the bach of the stamps (by arrange-</LINE>
	<LINE>ment with the Inland Eevenue Ofiice, Somerset</LINE>
	<LINE>House), or the initials perforated through the stamps</LINE>
	<LINE>by means of a machine devised for the purpose; so</LINE>
	<LINE>that, the sale of such stamps being thereby rendered</LINE>
	<LINE>difficult (Postmasters having been instructed not to</LINE>
	<LINE>purchase any of them), there may be little or no</LINE>
	<LINE>tempta;ion to steal them. The perforation of the</LINE>
	<LINE>stamps on post cards, newspaper wrappers, and</LINE>
	<LINE>embossed envelopes with initials is also not objected</LINE>
	<LINE>to.</LINE>
	<LINE>8. Paper taken by the public to the Inland</LINE>
	<LINE>Revenue Office can be impressed with postage stamps</LINE>
	<LINE>under conditions which may be learnt on application</LINE>
	<LINE>at that office.</LINE>

	<LINE>1. It is forbidden to forward by post any indecent</LINE>

	<LINE>or grossly offensive character. Anything posted</LINE>
	<LINE>contrary to this prohibition will be stopped and sent</LINE>
	<LINE>to the Returned Letter Office.</LINE>
	<LINE>2. Postmasters are instructed Bot to receive any</LINE>
	<LINE>lettter which there is good reason to believe contains</LINE>
	<LINE>anything likely to injure the contents of the mail</LINE>
	<LINE>bag, or to do bodily harm to any officer of the Post</LINE>
	<LINE>Office. If such a packet be posted without the</LINE>
	<LINE>Postmaster's knowledge, or if at any time before its</LINE>
	<LINE>despatch he should discover any such packet, he is</LINE>
	<LINE>directed not to forward it, but to report the case,</LINE>
	<LINE>with the address of the packet, to the Secretary.</LINE>
	<LINE>The following are examples of the articles referred</LINE>
	<LINE>to:—</LINE>

	<LINE>MISCELLANEOUS EEGULATIONS AKD</LINE>
	<LINE>SUGGESTIONS.</LINE>
	<LINE>1. The Post Office is not, by law, responsible for</LINE>
	<LINE>any loss or inconvenience which may arise from the</LINE>
	<LINE>non-delivery, mis-sending, or mis-delivery of any</LINE>
	<LINE>letter, book, or other postal packet (even if the</LINE>
	<LINE>packet be registered). Nor is it responsible for any</LINE>
	<LINE>injury which a letter or packet may sustain in its</LINE>
	<LINE>transmission.</LINE>
	<LINE>2. To guard against such injury all postal packets</LINE>
	<LINE>which are likely to suffer from stamping or from</LINE>
	<LINE>pressure should be placed in strong covers, and even</LINE>
	<LINE>with this'precaution no fragile aiticle should be sent</LINE>
	<LINE>through the post. It should be remembered that</LINE>
	<LINE>everypa ket has to be handled several times, that it</LINE>
	<LINE>is exposed to considerable pressure and friction in</LINE>
	<LINE>the mail bag, and that whenever the bag has, in the</LINE>
	<LINE>course of transmission, to be transferred by means</LINE>
	<LINE>of the Railway Post Office Apparatus, the risk of</LINE>
	<LINE>injury is much increased.</LINE>
	<LINE>3. No information can be given respecting letters</LINE>
	<LINE>which pass through a Post Office except to the</LINE>
	<LINE>persons to whom they are addressed ; and in no other</LINE>
	<LINE>way is official information of a private character</LINE>
	<LINE>allowed to be made public. A Postmaster, may,</LINE>
	<LINE>however, give an address if he has no reason to</LINE>
	<LINE>believe that the person whose address it is would</LINE>
	<LINE>disapprove of his doing so.</LINE>
	<LINE>4. Provision having been made, by means of the</LINE>
	<LINE>Post Office Guide, and the Postal Official Circular,</LINE>
	<LINE>to supply full and authentic information on all postal</LINE>
	<LINE>matters, the public should abstain, as much as</LINE>
	<LINE>possible, from applying for such information to the</LINE>
	<LINE>officers of the department. For any error in a</LINE>
	<LINE>reply to a verbal application the Department does not</LINE>
	<LINE>hold itself responsible.</LINE>
	<LINE>5. Postmasters are not allowed to return any</LINE>
	<LINE>letter or packet to the writer or sender, or to any</LINE>
	<LINE>one else, or to delay forwarding it to its destination,</LINE>
	<LINE>according to the address, even though a request to</LINE>
	<LINE>such effect be written thereon.</LINE>
	<LINE>6. Postmasters are not bound to give change,</LINE>
	<LINE>nor are they authorized to demand change; and</LINE>
	<LINE>when money is paid at a Post Office, whether as</LINE>
	<LINE>change or otherwise, no question as to its right</LINE>
	<LINE>amount, goodness, or weight can be entertained after</LINE>
	<LINE>it has been removed from the counter.</LINE>
	<LINE>7. Postmasters are not bound to weigh any letters</LINE>
	<LINE>or other packets for the public, but they may do so</LINE>
	<LINE>if their duty be not thereby impeded.</LINE>
	<LINE>8. If a letter be forwarded under cover to any</LINE>
	<LINE>Postmaster, with a request that he will re-post it at</LINE>
	<LINE>his i^office, the letter, on being re-posted, will be</LINE>
	<LINE>endorsed with the words " posted at , under r</LINE>
	<LINE>cover to the Postmaster of ."</LINE>
	<LINE>9. Every address should be legible and complete.</LINE>
	<LINE>When a letter is sent to a Post Town the last word</LINE>
	<LINE>in the address should be the name of that town,</LINE>
	<LINE>except when the town is but little known, or when i</LINE>
	<LINE>there are two Post Towns of the same name, or when i!</LINE>
	<LINE>the name of the town is identical with or very like (</LINE>
	<LINE>the name of some foreign town or country. In such I</LINE>
	<LINE>cases the name of the County should be added.</LINE>
	<LINE>Thus, the last part of the address of a letter to</LINE>
	<LINE>Newport in Monmouthshire should be —</LINE>
	<LINE>" Newport,</LINE>
	<LINE>Monmouthshire."</LINE>
