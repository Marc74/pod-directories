	<LINE>n^HE Engraving of the Widow's Cruse on the other page graphically</LINE>
	<LINE>■*■ illustrates the good service a Life Assurance Policy may</LINE>
	<LINE>render to the Widow, Fatherless, or other Dependents — indeed the</LINE>
	<LINE>benefits cannot be over estimated. The story of the Widow's Cruse is</LINE>
	<LINE>simple and easily told, A certain woman informs the Prophet Elisha that</LINE>
	<LINE>her husband is dead, and that the Creditor has come to take her two sons</LINE>
	<LINE>as bondmen. The Prophet, in consideration for the Widow's wants,</LINE>
	<LINE>multiplied her store of oil to such an extent that every vessel in the house</LINE>
	<LINE>was filled, and of these she had borrowed not a few. He then said to her,</LINE>
	<LINE>"Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debts, and live thou and thy children</LINE>
	<LINE>on the rest." Such is the story. — Now, Would a Scottish Provident</LINE>
	<LINE>Institution Life Policy not accomplish the same end? There can be</LINE>
	<LINE>no doubt that it would.</LINE>
	<LINE>The Distinctive Features of the Scottish Provident Institu-</LINE>
	<LINE>tion are: — A greatly larger original Assurance—generally from ^^1200</LINE>
	<LINE>to jQi2$o for the same yearly Premium as would elsewhere be charged</LINE>
	<LINE>(with whole profits) for ^,1000 only — with the prospect to good hves (for</LINE>
	<LINE>whom exclusively the surplus is reserved) of eventually receiving very con-</LINE>
	<LINE>siderable additions.</LINE>
	<LINE>While such are the advantages in respect of Terms, the Financial</LINE>
	<LINE>Position of the Institution is of the highest. The Accumulated Fund now</LINE>
	<LINE>exceeds ;^3,9i3,2 52.</LINE>
	<LINE>I will have much pleasure in furnishing you with a Copy of the Rates of</LINE>
	<LINE>Premium, Proposal Form, and give any information you may require.</LINE>
