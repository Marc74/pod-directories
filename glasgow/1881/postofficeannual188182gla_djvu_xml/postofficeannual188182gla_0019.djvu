	<LINE>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</LINE>
	<LINE>" The maps reduced from the Ordnance Survey Sheets of Scotland are deserving of a special word of</LINE>
	<LINE>praise, both on account of the care and slcill with which they are delineated, and for the handy, portable</LINE>
	<LINE>shape in which they are issued. The scale — half-an-inch to the mile — is sufficiently large to allow of</LINE>
	<LINE>every farm, patch of wood, streamlet, or eminence likely to attract the notice of the tourist, being plainly</LINE>
	<LINE>denoted ; and Mr John Bartholomew has shown excellent judgment, as well as bestowed great pains, in</LINE>
	<LINE>selecting the materials for the maps from the larger sheets. The heights of all the noteworthy eminences</LINE>
	<LINE>are given, but the roads and byeways of the country are indicated with special care. The result is a</LINE>
	<LINE>map at once clear, full, and accurate, and having the additional recommendations of being well mounted,</LINE>
	<LINE>tastefully tinted, and of convenient size." — Scotsman, 26th May 187.5.</LINE>
	<LINE>" We speak advisedly when we say that these maps are the only existing tourists' maps that can be</LINE>
	<LINE>depended upon for the exact distance from place to place marked on them. Not one of the hundreds of</LINE>
	<LINE>cheap maps even pretend to accuracy in this respect. . . . They wUl at once supersede all existing maps</LINE>
	<LINE>for the purposes of the tourist." — Courant.</LINE>
	<LINE>'• After a most careful .scrutiny of the many points and places of interest on the West Coast, we can</LINE>
	<LINE>testify to the skill and accuracy of Mr Bartholomew; while it is an additional recommendation that the</LINE>
	<LINE>delicacy and clearness of the engraving render the maps pleasant to the eye." — North British Daily Mail.</LINE>
	<LINE>" The map is carefully reduced from the Ordnance Survey; its scale is amply sufficient to show all the</LINE>
	<LINE>features likely to interest tourists and the general public." — Athenxum.</LINE>
