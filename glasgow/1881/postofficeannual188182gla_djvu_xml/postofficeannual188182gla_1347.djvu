	<LINE>DUFF'S Preparation for covering Marine Boilers, Superheaters, and Cylinders, is far a-head</LINE>
	<LINE>of any other Cement, more especially in three qualities: — 1st. It makes a " Cooler Job"</LINE>
	<LINE>at two inches thick than any other cement does at three inches thick, hence a greater saving in</LINE>
	<LINE>weight (it is of itself lighter than any other cement). 2nd. It is very " Elastic," it stands the</LINE>
	<LINE>rapid expansion and contraction that is sometimes unavoidable without cracking — " A Vital</LINE>
	<LINE>Virtue." 3rd. It is very "Tenacious;" once it gets a hold upon the metal it sticks fast. In</LINE>
	<LINE>other words, it excels, 1st, in Coolness and Lightness; 2nd, in Elasticity; 3rd, in Tenacity.</LINE>
	<LINE>Ilarine Engineers please ponder over this!</LINE>
