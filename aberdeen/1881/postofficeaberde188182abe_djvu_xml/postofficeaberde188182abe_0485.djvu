	<LINE>ALL KINDS OF MAGNETIC APPLIANCES AT REDUCED PRICES,</LINE>
	<LINE>rjiHE "SPECIAL" MAGNETIC APPLIANCES prevent or cure disease by</LINE>
	<LINE>1 strengthening the nerve centres. The nerves do the greater part of the</LINE>
	<LINE>work in the body. All loss of motion, weakness or paralysis arises from an</LINE>
	<LINE>absence of these elements. A good Magnetic Belt will last for years, and with</LINE>
	<LINE>ordinary care in diet will prevent indigestion or internal weakness. A Mag-</LINE>
	<LINE>netic protector worn over the chest or spine will guard the lungs. Magnetic</LINE>
	<LINE>soles will keep the feet warm and prevent chilblains, and Magnetism is the</LINE>
	<LINE>best and most simple cure for Rheumatism. This is all effected because it</LINE>
	<LINE>maintains a perfect circulation. The portion of the body requiring most pro-</LINE>
	<LINE>tection is the spine, especially between the shoulder blades ; spine proctectors</LINE>
	<LINE>are as necessary as chest protectors, hence the great value of the lung</LINE>
	<LINE>invigorators.</LINE>
	<LINE>These well-known Appliances are popular among all classes of society. They</LINE>
	<LINE>are of first-class quality and celebrated for their great curative power. They</LINE>
	<LINE>are also very comfortable to wear, and are now permanently Magnetic.</LINE>

	<LINE>Lumbago, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Spinal Diseases, Nervous or Gen-</LINE>
	<LINE>eral Debility, &amp;c., The "SPECIAL" MAGNETIC CURATIVE APPLIANCES</LINE>
	<LINE>are a simple, natural, and efficient remedy, and what is essential to many and</LINE>
	<LINE>important to all is the fact that this is an inexpensive and safe remedy.</LINE>
	<LINE>Some of the special advantages of these Appliances are their simplicity and</LINE>
	<LINE>safety. They constantly generate Electricity without the aid of Batteries,</LINE>
	<LINE>Metallic Plates, Chain Bands, or Acids. They require no preparation or care,</LINE>
	<LINE>and are as comfortable to wear as an ordinary garment.</LINE>
	<LINE>Magnetic Appliances are made for children who are found to be peculiarly</LINE>
	<LINE>susceptible to the invigorating influence of magnetism.</LINE>
	<LINE>The influence of Magnetic Appliances is so gentle and harmless, that the</LINE>
	<LINE>most delicate invalid need have no fear in wearing those charged with the</LINE>
	<LINE>highest power. They are made of light material, give no shocks, and cause</LINE>
	<LINE>no sores ; the Magnetic current passes readily through an undergarment, and</LINE>
	<LINE>contact with the body is not necessary.</LINE>
